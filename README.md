# GravitySimulator
A 2D gravity simulator. Hopefully I will be able to simulate newtonian gravity with a couple of thousands particles. The aim is to not use the naive n^2 method of computing the forces but to use spatial partitioning to achieve much higher count of particles. I plan to include dark matter in order to recreate galaxy-like structures.
